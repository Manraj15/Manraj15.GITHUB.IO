				<p>I'm currently a second year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto (looking for 2019 summmer internship). As you can probably guess, I like building software! Being able to create things that others use gives me a kind of reward that I just can't find anywhere else, and seeing my ideas come to fruition is incredibly exciting. Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading and gardening. Checkout my 2019 reading list below! Also, if you ever need some vegetables in the summer, I'm your man.</p>
